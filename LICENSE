This file details the licensing information for the supplementary materials
for the article "Further Steps Towards a Standard Testbed for Optical Music Recognition"
by Jan Hajič jr., Jiří Novotný, Pavel Pecina and Jaroslav Pokorný.

The copyright to this repository belongs to Jan Hajič jr. and Jiří Novotný,

There are different licensing requirements for code and data. This file details
which licenses apply to which parts of this repository. Please read this file
carefully.

Generally, if you are in academia,
you should have absolutely zero licensing issues working with anything in here
(but please do check anyway); if you are in industry, just pay extra attention to
the GPL 2.0 license for code and the Share-Alike clause for the human judgments
we have collected.


Data
================

The content of the muscima++/data folder and the muscima++/README.md file
are provided under a Creative Commons 4.0 Attribution license.

The content of the evaluations/costs folder and the evaluations/REAMDE.md file
are provided under a Creative Commons 4.0 Attribution license.

The content of the evaluations/annotations and evaluations/test_case_corpus folders
is provided under a Creative Commons 4.0 Attribution Share-Alike license.

The Share-Alike clause is a key difference. You can do anything with MUSCIMA++, as long
as you credit its creators as required by the terms of the CC 4.0 license.
However, if you do anything (modification/derivative work...) with
the evaluations data, you are required to let it remain copylefted under the same
CC-BY-SA terms. The Share-Alike is what adds this additional obligation.
This is because we believe transparency in evaluating OMR is key
for the community, and ensuring the evaluation data stays publicly
available is paramount for replicability. Of course, if you have good reason,
you can contact us and we can work out some separate licensing scheme.

The text of the Creative Commons Attribution (CC-BY) and Creative Commons Attribution Share-Alike
(CC-BY-SA) licenses can be found in the LICENSE.CC-BY and LICENSE.CC-BY-SA files
in this directory.


Code
================

The content of the muscima++/code and evaluations/code folders is provided
under the GPL 2.0 license. (This is mostly because of the Levenshtein package,
which we use extensively: it is provided under GPL 2.0.)

The text of the GPL 2.0 license can be found in the LICENSE.GPL file in this directory.
