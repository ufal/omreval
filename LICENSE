This file details the licensing information for the supplementary materials
for the article "Further Steps Towards a Standard Testbed for Optical Music Recognition"
by Jan Hajič jr., Jiří Novotný, Pavel Pecina and Jaroslav Pokorný.

The licensing situation is a little complicated due to two factors.
First, the copyright for the human judgment data belongs to the annotators.
Second, we tie together many technologies that have different licensing
requirements, some more restrictive than others, and we want to place
as few restrictions on using our code as possible.

That being said, if you are in academia, you will generally have no licensing
issues with our work. If you are a business, however, make sure you comply
especially with the data licencing requirements (CC-BY-SA, see below)
and the portions of our code that link to GPL technologies.

Data
================

The content of the muscima++/data folder and the muscima++/README.md file
are provided under a Creative Commons 4.0 Attribution license.

The content of the evaluations/costs folder and the evaluations/REAMDE.md file
are provided under a Creative Commons 4.0 Attribution license.

The content of the evaluations/annotations and evaluations/test_case_corpus folders
is provided under a Creative Commons 4.0 Attribution Share Alike license.

The Share-Alike clause is a key difference. You can do anything with MUSCIMA++, as long
as you credit its creators as required by the terms of the CC 4.0 license.
However, if you do anything (modification/derivative work...) with
the evaluations data, you are required to let it remain copylefted under the same
CC-BY-SA terms. The Share-Alike is what adds this additional obligation.
This is because we believe transparency in evaluating OMR is key
for the community, and ensuring the evaluation data stays publicly
available is paramount for replicability. Of course, if you have good reason,
you can contact us and we can work out some separate licensing scheme.



Code
================

The content of the muscima++/code and evaluations/code folders is provided
under the MIT license, with the exception of the following files that must
be provided under LGPL 3.0, as they import the Levenshtein and zss packages
that are distributed under such terms.
