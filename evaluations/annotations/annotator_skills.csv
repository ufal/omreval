# This file records the self-reported notation software usage
# skill levels of individual annotators.
#
# Skill levels, as explained to the annotators:
#
# 1: Sporadic user, uses mouse even for pitch input.
# 2: Infrequent user, can input pitches and perform basic edits
#    with keyboard shortcuts.
# 3: Frequent user (several 10s of pages), uses keyboard shortcuts
#    for more or less everything (when efficient).
# 4: Expert user, extensive editorial work (like a symphony), can define
#    their own software behavior (shortcuts, macros...) to suit their needs.
#
# When we got uncertain responses (3 people), we adjusted for the Dunning-Kruger effect
# and moved people self-reporting between 3 and 4 to 4 and between 1 and 2 to 1.
# (Fortunately, no one reported between 2 and 3.)
